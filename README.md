I’m an engineer who is interested in **Automated Systems** and **Next-Gen Web Technologies**.

I was born in the United States 🇺🇸 , growing up in Arizona 🏜 and currently living in New York City 🗽.

I work as a Senior Software Engineer @ [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/about/company) on the Character team. We're a small team of two engineers and two designers who bring trendy and bespoke website design elements to the Squarespace website editor product. This allows our customers to build a website that has character — standing out by expressing their story in an esthetic and engaging way.

See the projects pinned below to see what I've been interested in lately 👇🏻
